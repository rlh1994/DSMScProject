## Code files
Code files are available in their original notebook format within the `Files and Scripts` folder and are numbered in sequential order for ease of workflow. All paths were designed to work on Google Colab mounted to my Google Drive containing the relevant data.

The additional analysis files completed in R are also located in this folder, however these run locally at the same level as this repository.

## Data Files (non-images)
All data files including labels, predictions, and other tabular data is stored in the `Files and Scripts` folder also.

## Report
The report and the underlying LaTeX file is available within the `Tex` folder.

## Links to drive folders
Due to the volume of image data and the size of the model configurations they cannot be uploaded to the repository, but can be accessed at time of submission by a Birkbeck Google Account at the following links to shared folders.
